This problem requires basic knowledge of how to perform an SQL injection. If we cancel the
login, we are brought to the screen which tells us that the password is hashed, and that
the query checks to see if only one row is returned. We do not know the password, and
but we can limit the number of rows down to one. We can do this by setting the username to

    ' OR 1=1 LIMIT 1 --

which will yield the flag.
