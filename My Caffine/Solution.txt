Coffee-pot-command refers to hyper text coffee pot control protocol.
We send commands using either BREW or post, with Content-Type set to 'application/coffee-pot-command'.
If we send 23 using POST, we get a message saying that the coffee is beginning to be made.
Then, we send a WHEN request, and when we do that, we are given some sort of cipher.
If we then send a PROPFIND request, we are given the encryption method to decrypt the cipher, which is the flag.
