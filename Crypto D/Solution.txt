The problem tells us the number is semi-prime, which means that it is the product of
two primes. We can guess now that the cipher used was RSA, and that the semi-prime
is the product of p and q. The hint revealed that the exponent used would be the most
commonly used one, which is 65537. In order to get the primes from the semi prime, we used msieve, which was in another hint.
Running decode.py reveals the flag.
