Opening the Anonymous PDF in Adobe Reader reveals the Secrets.docx attachment. Then you can see that there was
some small line of text in the document. This was text and it is present in both the footer and header.
The Google Drive link in the footer led to a .cpt file. The string in the header is an md5 hash of the key.
Using ccrypt,

    sudo apt-get install ccrypt
    ccdecrypt \=\).txt.cpt

it is possible to decrypt the .cpt file with the key.
