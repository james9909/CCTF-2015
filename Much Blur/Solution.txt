We used gimp to find the flag:
First we opened the picture in Gimp. Then we destripped the picture by going to
Filters --> Enhance. After that, we tried to unblur the picture by using
Unsharp Mask, also in Enhance. Using a combination of Unsharp Mask and
by changing the brightness by going to Colors --> Brightness-Contrast,
we were able to unblur the hidden text, which was the flag.
