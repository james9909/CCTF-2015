I opened the picture in Gimp. Then I destriped the picture by going to
Filters --> Enhance. After that, I tried to unblur the picture by using
Unsharp Mask, also in Enhance. Using a combination of Unsharp Mask and
by changing the brightness by going to Colors --> Brightness-Contrast,
I was able to unblur the hidden text, which was the flag.
