To solve this problem, I used the Windows cmd prompt (ik who uses that right)

The problem name is Stream 1, and the hint at the home page suggests that something is
hidden via a method called alternate data stream. A quick look at the hex for the rar
reveals that within there somewhere is a file called flag.txt. If we extract the file
however, we are given a docx file which says that there is nothing to see. On the contrary,
if we type in:

    dir /r

We can see that there is a hidden file called secret.docx:flag.txt, with flag.txt
being in an alternate data stream. By cat-ting the file with

    cat secret.docx:flag.txt

we are given the flag.
